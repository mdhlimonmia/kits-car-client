                <h1 className="text-3xl py-5">What is an access token and refresh token?</h1>
                <p className="text-xl" >An access token and refresh token are commonly used in authentication systems to verify the identity of a user and grant them access to protected resources or perform certain actions on behalf of the user. Heres a brief explanation of each:
<br />
Access Token: An access token is a credential that is issued to a user after they successfully authenticate with a server or service. It is typically a string of characters that represents the users identity and permissions. The access token is used to gain access to protected resources or perform specific operations for a limited period of time. It serves as a proof of authentication and authorization during subsequent requests.</p>

                <p className="text-xl" >Access tokens and refresh tokens work together to facilitate the authentication process and secure access to resources. Heres a general overview of how they work:
<br />
Authentication: The user provides their credentials (such as username and password) to the authentication server. If the credentials are valid, the server generates an access token and a refresh token.</p>

                <h1 className="text-3xl py-5">Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</h1>
                <p className="text-xl" >SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems, each with its own strengths and use cases. Heres a comparison between the two:

Data Model:

SQL Structured Query Language: SQL databases use a structured data model based on tables with fixed schemas. The data is organized into rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using foreign keys. <br />
NoSQL Not Only SQL: NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, including key-value, document, columnar, and graph. These models provide more flexibility and scalability, as they allow for storing and retrieving data in non-tabular formats.</p>

                <h1 className="text-3xl py-5">What is express js?</h1>
                <p className="text-xl" >Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, which is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is one of the most popular frameworks for building web applications and APIs using JavaScript on the server-side.
<br />
Express.js provides a minimalist and unopinionated approach to web development, allowing developers to have fine-grained control over the design and structure of their applications. It simplifies the process of building web servers and handling HTTP requests and responses.</p>

                <h1 className="text-3xl py-5">What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?</h1>
                <p className="text-xl" >MongoDB aggregation framework is a powerful tool used for data processing and analysis within MongoDB databases. It provides a way to perform complex data manipulations, transformations, and computations on collections of documents. The aggregation framework is designed to process data in a pipeline fashion, where multiple stages are applied sequentially to transform the input data into the desired output.
<br />
The aggregation pipeline consists of one or more stages, and each stage performs a specific operation on the documents flowing through the pipeline. The output of each stage becomes the input for the next stage, allowing for a series of transformations to be applied.</p>
